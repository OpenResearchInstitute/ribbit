# ribbit
distributed terrestrial communications over amateur radio


Hello there. I am W4CKX - Pierre.
I am the inventor of Ribbit, a by Hams, for Hams distributed messaging network working across Radio links & Cellular with equipment every Ham owns: a simple HT & a smartphone.

I am working on a poster to explain the network architecture, and it will be followed by a white paper to explain the network benefits for fun and for disaster communications.

Looking forward to meet with you, answer any questions and build a working group.
