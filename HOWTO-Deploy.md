This project uses react-gh-pages to deploy the site to GitHub Pages.
Details on the setup and use of react-gh-pages can be found at https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages

TL;DR
To deploy your changes from your local system:

```
npm run deploy
```

## react-gh-pages

This utility builds and deploys from your local code and does not require you to push changes to the remote repo.

So, don't forget to commit your changes to the remote repo using whatever git workflow you like.
